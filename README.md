## 🌌 SlizzAi v3.6 — Eco-Intelligent HDR Image Generation Framework

SlizzAi v3.6 is a production-grade rendering and image-processing pipeline that fuses photorealistic fidelity, fractal-trained super-sampling, golden-ratio compression, and sustainable resource management. Built atop Unreal Engine 5’s Nanite and Lumen systems, it delivers 16K HDR imagery under a 1-liter/day cooling budget — redefining creative infrastructure for artists, studios, and simulation labs.

### 🧬 Codex v3.5 — Procedural AI Creative Engine

SlizzAi-Codex-3.5.py introduces a GUI-driven orchestration layer for procedural 3D modeling, physics simulation, animation styling, and real-time Unreal sync. It includes:

- Visual prompt styling (anime, tactical, cinematic)
- Self-learning mesh generation
- Organism evolution based on biome/environment
- Pose retargeting and destruction simulation
- Energy VFX (Power Equator) with live sliders
- Bi-directional Unreal Engine bridge
